### Colour Palette

![Colour Palette](docs/images/colour-palette.png)

The colour scheme is inspired by vintage Japanese posters and car manuals, reinforcing cultural authenticity. A deep indigo and vivid red establish strong visual hierarchy, helping users focus on key elements, while muted tones and the 'linen' background colour reduce eye strain for longer reading sessions.

- Contrast and Legibility: The design uses light-on-dark and dark-on-light combinations that meet WCAG contrast guidelines for accessibility.
- Consistency: A limited but consistent palette is used across the site to reinforce a clear visual identity.
- Emotional Impact:
    - Red conveys excitement and speed — key elements of car culture.
    - Indigo represents technology and reliability.
    - Grey tones evoke modernity and balance the more vibrant accents.
- Focus: Accent colours are strategically used for CTA buttons, hover states, and navigation to guide the user’s attention.

### Imagery

All images aim to focus on JDM cars in real-world scenes to reflect the raw, energetic feel of JDM culture.

Some images were sourced from multiple sources due to limited availability of high-quality contextual imagery from free image providers. JDM Culture was made for an education project with no commerical value and all image credits are listed below.

### Typography

The site uses two fonts from Google Fonts to support both clarity and aesthetic impact:

- Russo One for headings: A bold, blocky display typeface that mirrors the strong, angular lines of classic JDM car design.
- Roboto for body text: A clean, modern sans-serif font optimised for readability on screens of all sizes.

This combination delivers contrast between structure and content, while maintaining a cohesive style across the site.

### User Interface

UI choices were made to enhance usability without distracting from content:

- Hover Effects: Interactive elements such as buttons, navigation links, and car tiles change shade on hover to give clear feedback.
